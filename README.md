# Mobile App Dev Homework 1

A new Flutter project. 

● My app first begins with having a splash screen appear with a picture of me and
the title Fan Page.
● It then takes you to my login page where you can either login or register.
● If you choose to register it will take you to the register page and after you register
you will be logged in.
● If you are already an existing user, you can log in with your email address and
password.
● Or you can use Google Sign In (Gmail) to sign in.
● After you log in, you will be taken to the user view page which has all of the
messages posted by the admin.
● If you are an admin, once you log in, your view of the home page will be a little
different. You will have the same ability to see previous messages but you now
have a plus button in the top right corner that allows you to make posts and post
them for users to see.
● Both the users and admins can log out by clicking the button in the bottom right
corner of their screen; this will prompt an alert dialog asking them if they’re sure
they want to log out.
● My App works for both Android and iOS
